So I've had been thinking to create my protfolio around for some time, but with all
the other interesting (and in some cases, semi-secret) projects I've been working on it took me
a little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately,thanks to @Niranjani Wagh who had made things  eased up
enough for me by her work to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce my protfolio. Hope you dig it :)
