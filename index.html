							<h1>Sravya Gangula</h1>
							<p> Satya Nadella's quote, "The true scarce commodity of the future will be human attention," deeply resonates with me. As a full-time Data Science student at the University of Florida, 
								I am passionate about AI, machine learning, and data science. With a solid foundation in this field, my goal is to become a Data Scientist and push the boundaries of technological innovation. 
								I believe that the convergence of AI, machine learning, and data science will redefine industries and create transformative solutions. My experience includes problem-solving, technical writing, 
								and communication skills, along with expertise in data extraction, ML algorithms, and predictive modeling. I have also honed my decision-making, teamwork, and adaptability through extracurricular activities. 
								My dedication to making a meaningful impact in the world of AI and data science drives me, as I believe AI has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve lives. Inspired by Sam Altman's words, 
								I am committed to harnessing the power of AI to drive innovation and address real-world challenges. Enrolled as a full-time Data Science student at the University of Florida, I am ready to contribute 
								to the advancement of AI and data science, exceeding expectations and leaving a lasting impact.

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>I believe that practical coding skills or projects are the fundamental literacy in the digital world. 
								Understanding and being able to use the technology in the world is crucial for a programmer.
								Here are a few coding examples I've created since I finished my Data Science master's degree to show my knowledge, creativity, math skills, and confidence.

									<h3>Email Classification</h3>
									<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.  
										Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.</p>

									<h2>Skills & Organizations</h2>
									<p>Skills are a important aspect of a person's career as they define your ability in your domain. In my opinion, with skills and 
										knowledge, socializing is also and important aspect. Throughout my academic career, I have joined a lot of clubs and organizations 
										for improving my self confidence, public speaking and networking. Technical as well as Non- technical knowledge are important when 
										it comes to thriving in the society. Here are a few of my skills and the organizations that I have joined uptil now.
